## About the Game
**Cemetery Clash: Halloween** is a Halloween-themed battle game where you control **Midnight Skeleton** and face waves of enemies in a haunted graveyard. The goal is to survive through increasingly challenging rounds, with multiple stages in each one.

## How to Play
- **Move:** WASD (works with French AZERTY as well)
- **Run:** Hold **Shift** while moving
- **Jump:** **Spacebar**
- **Attack:** Left **click**

On mobile, the controls are displayed directly on the screen for easy access.

## Enemies
Each enemy type has unique behaviors and attack styles:
- **Spiders**: Attack from a distance by shooting blood
- **Skeletons**: Chase and relentlessly attack the player
- **Crawling zombies**: Attempt to grab you as they approach
- **Slimes**: Slide towards the player to attack

## Development Journey
This is my first project with Three.js, completed after just three months of study. The game was created for **Challenge 14 - Halloween 2** in the Three.js Journey course. Although the code could use some refactoring, particularly for enemy behaviors, I had limited time for the challenge. I hope to add new features and improvements in the future. Overall, it was an amazing learning experience, and I'm excited to share it!

## Technologies Used
- **GSAP**: For animations
- **Vue**: JavaScript framework for building the UI
- **Troika-Three-Text**: For rendering text in the 3D scene
- **NippleJS**: For mobile joystick controls
- **TresJS**: Wrapper for Three.js in Vue
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering library
- **Vite**: Fast build and development tool

## Future Improvements
I know thereâ€™s still a lot I could improve:

- **Code Refactoring:**: Especially around enemy behaviors to make the code cleaner and more efficient.
- **New Features:**: I'd like to add more enemy types, levels, and potentially power-ups.
